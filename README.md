## Introduction
The MIT Interactive Campus Map project aims to create a comprehensive and visually appealing map of the MIT campus. This project is divided into three phases:   

1. 2D Static Map: A detailed PDF map of the campus.
2. Web Map: A web-based map where users can select objects to view related information.
3. Full-Scale Interactive Map: An interactive map displaying real-time events and activities on campus.  
This project was inspired by the need for an updated and user-friendly campus map to assist students, staff, and visitors in navigating the MIT campus effectively. (And also because it was a cool thing to work on : )

## Project Phases
Phase 1: 2D Static Map (PDF)  
- Goal: Create a detailed and accurate static map of the campus.
- Tools Used: QGIS, OpenStreetMap, satellite images.
- Major Features:
  1. Accurate representation of buildings, roads, and pathways.
  2. Color-coded gradients to indicate slopes due to the campus's mountainous terrain.
  3. (more to be added with time)  
  
Phase 2: Web Map
- Goal: Develop a web-based map with selectable objects displaying related information.
- Tools Used: Leaflet/Mapbox/OpenLayers, GeoJSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Major Features:
  1. Interactive layers that users can toggle on and off.
  2. Tooltips or pop-ups providing information about selected objects.
  
Phase 3: Full-Scale Interactive Map
- Goal: Create a fully interactive map showing real-time events and activities on campus.
- Tools Used: Advanced web mapping libraries, real-time data integration.
- Major Features:
  1. Real-time updates on events and activities.
  2. Enhanced user interaction and navigation.
  
## Technology Stack
1. GIS Software: QGIS for map creation and data management.
2. Web Mapping Libraries: Leaflet, Mapbox, or OpenLayers for web map development.
3. Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web development.
4. Data Formats: Shapefiles, GeoJSON for data handling.

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites:-  
1. QGIS installed for Phase 1 work.  
2. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Phase 2.  
3. Familiarity with web mapping libraries (Leaflet/Mapbox/OpenLayers).

### Installation:-
